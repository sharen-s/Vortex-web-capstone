# Vortex

Vortex is a social media similar to Reddit where discussions are organized into forums. Anonymous users may view forums, posts, and replies, while authenticated users can also create forums, moderate forums, make posts in forums, reply to posts, and vote on posts.

## Installation
First, navigate to the database folder and run the bash command below to import the dummy data which initially populates the site

```bash
sh create.sh
```

Next, open the Java folder and run the main class of the application. This is the back end server for the site.

Next, open the folder called vue in VS Code and run this command in the terminal

```bash
npm install
```
Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the application on port 8080

```bash
npm run serve
```
## Usage
  
Feel free to explore all the different components of the application.
